For project 1, I run the folowing command "7z x secret.zip" in my terminal to ensure that the 7z file is unzipped and able to access the password from the extracted comment. The comment given was then turned into a txt document where every word was on an individual line and this was done with a simple for loop that printed the words that were later pasted into a password.txt file.
At first I started trying every word from the comment for a possible password and I was able to use 'pellentesque' as a password for secret.1 and unlocking secret1.png , but the process became cumbersome and therefore ended up writing a script in terminal which is essentially will read over in my password.txt file and check for the possible passwords in the 7z files(This was loosely based on the idea of 7z x FILENAME -pPASSWORD that was observed during class in Tuesday). The process was succesful and I was able to get all images from the 7zfiles. There was no date on the artifact and I therefore searched up the artist "Noah Regan" and the details suggest that the artifact was created on the 23rd of May 2020.
