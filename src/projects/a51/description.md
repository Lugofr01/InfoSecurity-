# A5/1 Cipher

## Task

Implement A5/1 cipher.

## Implementation

Implement all functions necessary for proper encryption and decryption using A5/1 cipher. See the textbook for details of the algorithm.

Note that some functions return numbers as `int` and some - as `str`. See the type annotations for specifics.

## Assumptions

Note that for the sake of output comparison, lines of the input file are encrypted independently and the keystream is generated for each of them.
