*I used https://crackstation.net/ to crack the first 9 from Sam.
*I used John the Ripper to crack from passwd and shadow
In John the Ripper, I had to run the folliwng command for my sam file
franklugola$ john Documents/GitHub/InfoSecurity-/data/projects/passwords/sam --format=NT --wordlist=Desktop/exim.txt and set to the format NT as recommended by the john the ripper.
What I'll do is to copy and paste all the worldlists from the links provided and put it into exim.txt for easy access of the program to function.
This process was repeated throughout the files and gave me a couple passwords which were put togehter in a google document and later added to the solution.txt for submission

\*Most of the passwords were obtained from

\*This repository was also useful for my password cracking endavours

Furthermore, I tried several random words such as which would fit in context of CS 460, I also used words provided from random data files provided on cs 460 to see if I'd get a few more passwords.
